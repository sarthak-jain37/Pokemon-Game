# Pokémon Game

## Description

This project has been inspired by the Pokémon games made by GameFreak. The Pokémon Game is a simple text-based game in which players can choose their favourite starter Pokémon from the Kanto Region and engage in turn-based battles against rival Pokémon. This game is designed to simulate the classic Pokémon battle experience, where each Pokémon has unique moves, advantages, and attributes. 

## Features

- Choose from three Pokémon: Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle.
- Engage in turn-based battles with a Computer Rival.
- Each Pokémon has a different set of moves with different base powers.
- The effectiveness of moves is determined by type advantages.
- The battle continues until either the player’s or rival's Pokémon faints.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The game is developed in Java, utilizing its object-oriented features for creating Pokémon and battle mechanics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- An IDE or text editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA).

### Installation

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sarthak-jain37/Pokemon-Game.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Pokemon-Game
3. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   java Game
   
# How to Play

Upon running the game, you will be prompted to choose a Pokémon by entering a number (1 for Bulbasaur, 2 for Charmander, or 3 for Squirtle).
After making your selection, you will face a rival Pokémon in a battle.
Choose your moves and see if you can defeat your rival!

#Future Enhancements

1. Adding types for moves as well rather than basing attack power solely on the Pokémon's type.
2. Adding the concept of PP so the stronger moves aren't used excessively.
3. Currently Status Moves do not have much functionality, so functionality will be added.
4. Implementation of Accuracy, Evasion and Critical Hits.
